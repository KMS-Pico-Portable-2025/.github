However, some note several drawbacks to KMSpico as opposed to buying the Windows or Microsoft Suite licensing keys.

First off, users must constantly run the application in the background in order to maintain consistent operating system support. Depending on the age of the device it's running on, this may cause severe lags or overheating within minutes of installation.

Additionally, some users note that KMSpico has caused their built-in operating system and preinstalled apps to slow down, delay, or stop functioning all together. Since KMSpico functions as a Windows emulator, it can cause incompatibilities during its runtime. In fact, the software may cause firewalls, anti-virus software, and other security measures to stop working.

Moreover, many complain that it's difficult to fully uninstall KMSpico once it's been added to their device.
